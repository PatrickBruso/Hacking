# Hacking - The Art of Exploitation
### By Jon Erickson (2d Ed)

<p>This repository is for the programs from Jon Erickson's Hacking - The Art of Exploitation.  I have
updated the programs as necessary when they will not compile without errors.  My goal is to have the
output of the compiled program match the output in the book.  In some circumstances, I have noted the flags to run when compiling to ignore certain errors.  In other circumstnaces, I have changed the programs.  These changes are generally noted in a comment at the top of each program.</p>
